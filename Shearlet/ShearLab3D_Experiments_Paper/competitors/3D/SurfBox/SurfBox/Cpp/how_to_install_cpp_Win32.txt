Follow the five steps below to compile and use the SurfBox-C++ code.

(1) Obtain and install the precompiled FFTW 3.1.1 windows dLLs.

    - Following the instructions on http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html.
    - Be sure to copy the FFTW dlls to a directory that is on the system search path.

    It is also possible to directly compile the source files of FFTW and link them as a static library, but this is out of the scope of this guide.

    In the following steps, we use C:\home\fftw-3.1 to denote the directory in which you put the FFTW lib definition files. You should modify it according to your settings.


(2) Create a VC++ solution (project) containing all the SurfBox c++ and h files.
    You can use the included test_surfacelet project as a starting point.

(3) Specify the necessary header files for the FFTW package

    In VC - Project Properties - C/C++ - General - Additional Include Directories, add the directory info C:\home\fftw-3.1

(4) In VC - Project Properties - Linker - General - Additional Library Directories, add the directory info C:\home\fftw-3.1

(5) In VC - Project Properties - Linker - Input - Additional Dependencies, add libfftw3-3.lib
