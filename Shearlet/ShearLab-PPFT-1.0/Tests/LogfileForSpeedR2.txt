Test Speed: 
N = 32, FwdSHT_Speed = 0.0374 secs, FFT_Speed = 0.000137 sec 
N = 64, FwdSHT_Speed = 0.0393 secs, FFT_Speed = 0.001026 sec 
N = 128, FwdSHT_Speed = 0.1255 secs, FFT_Speed = 0.000679 sec 
N = 256, FwdSHT_Speed = 0.3915 secs, FFT_Speed = 0.002227 sec 
N = 512, FwdSHT_Speed = 1.3935 secs, FFT_Speed = 0.012781 sec 
Now the computation of the three measures!Speed. Complexity: Mspeed1 = 0.992181
Speed. The Constant: Mspeed2 = 1.389089E-005
Speed. Comparision with 2D-FFT: Mspeed3 = 156.073875
