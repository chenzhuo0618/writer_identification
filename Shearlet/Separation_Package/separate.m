function [C P] = separate(img,level2,itermax,stop,gamma,coeff,display,shear)

% This routine performs image separation to separate two geometrically 
% different objects (points + curves).
% This routine builds up on MCA2_Bcr.m (in MCALab110 ) written by J. M. Fadili. 
%
%Output : P : separated image which mainly contains points.
%         C : separated image which mainly contains curves. 
%
%Input : 
%
%img : input image
%level2 : The number of levels for wavelet transform
%
%stop : stopping criterion ( eg. stop = 3 or 4)
%;
%itermax : the number of iterations of modified relaxation method.
%
%gamma: paramater for TV (soft-threshold) (e.g gamma = 3 or 4).
%
%coeff : coeff = [coeff(1)...coeff(L)] where 
%        L : the number of frequency bands.
%        coeff(j) : weight coefficient for each frequency band.
%        coeff(1) : weight for low frequecny 
%        ...
%        coeff(L) : weight for high frequency
%        ( see 're_weight_band.m'. )     
%
%display : display = 1 ---> display output of each iteration
%          
%shear : cell array of shearlet filters computed from shearing_filters_Myer.m
%      (see shearing_filters_Myer.m)
